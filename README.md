## Local Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL

#### Option A: Use Docker for Database Only

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ardine-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=ardine \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:17-alpine
```

#### Option B: Use Local PostgreSQL

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running, then create the database:


```bash
createdb ardine
```

### 3. Initialize Database Schema

```bash
psql -U postgres -d ardine -f ardine_ddl.sql
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
# Database
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=ardine
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Application
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Database Schema

Ardine uses a multi-tenant architecture with the following main entities:

- **Users** - User accounts with instance-level roles (USER/ADMIN)
- **Teams** - Workspaces for organizing users and data
- **Team Memberships** - Links users to teams with roles (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER/VIEWER/BILLING)
- **Clients** - Client information and billing details
- **Projects** - Projects with budgets, rates, and team assignments
- **Project Tasks** - Tasks within projects with custom rates
- **Time Entries** - Tracked time with billable status
- **Invoices** - Generated invoices with line items
- **Invoice Items** - Line items linking time entries to invoices

### Key Relationships

- Teams contain clients, projects, and time entries (tenant isolation)
- Projects belong to clients and have members
- Time entries link to projects, tasks, and users
- Invoices aggregate time entries into line items

## API Documentation

### REST API

All REST endpoints are located under `/api/*`:

#### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

#### Admin (ADMIN role required)

- `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users
- `GET /api/admin/teams` - List all teams
- `GET /api/admin/clients` - List all clients
- `GET /api/admin/projects` - List all projects

### GraphQL API

GraphQL endpoint: `POST /api/graphql`

The GraphQL API provides flexible querying with:

- Pagination support with offset/limit
- Filtering by status, date ranges, and search terms
- Nested relationships and eager loading
- Connection-based results with total counts

Example query:

```graphql
query {
	team(id: "...") {
		id
		name
		projects(status: "active", limit: 10) {
			nodes {
				id
				name
				client {
					name
				}
				tasks {
					nodes {
						name
						status
					}
				}
			}
			total
		}
	}
}
```

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- 7-day token expiration
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Authorization Levels

#### Instance Level (users table)

- **ADMIN** - Full system access, can manage all teams and users
- **USER** - Standard user with team-based permissions

#### Team Level (team_memberships table)

- **OWNER** - Full team control
- **ADMIN** - Manage team settings and members
- **MEMBER** - Create/edit projects and time entries
- **VIEWER** - Read-only access
- **BILLING** - Manage invoices and billing

#### Project Level (project_members table)

- **MANAGER** - Full project control
- **CONTRIBUTOR** - Log time and update tasks
- **VIEWER** - Read-only project access

### First User Setup

When the database is empty, the first registered user automatically receives the ADMIN instance role, allowing them to manage the entire system.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Code Generation (GraphQL)

```bash
npm run codegen
```

## Common Tasks

### Creating a New User (Admin)

1. Navigate to `/admin/users`
2. Users can self-register via `/register`
3. First user automatically becomes ADMIN

### Inviting Users to a Team

Since email sending is not yet implemented, team invitations work via shareable links:

1. Navigate to Team Settings
2. Enter the user's email address in the invite form
3. **Click the "Copy Invite Link" button** (email won't be sent automatically)
4. Share the copied invite link directly with the user (via Slack, email client, etc.)
5. User clicks the link and registers/logs in to accept the invitation

**Note for Admins**: When creating a new team via `/admin/teams`, enter an email address and use the "Copy Invite Link" button. This generates an invite link that grants **OWNER** role in that team.

### Setting Up a Team

1. Register as the first user (becomes ADMIN)
2. Create a team (automatic on first registration)
3. Invite team members using the invite link workflow described above

### Creating Invoices

1. Track time on projects with billable entries
2. Navigate to Invoices
3. Create new invoice and select time entries
4. Review and mark as sent/paid

### Configuring Billing Rates

Rates cascade in this order:

1. Task-level hourly rate (highest priority)
2. Project-level hourly rate
3. Client-level hourly rate
4. Manual entry rate (lowest priority)

## Known Limitations

### No Email Sending (Currently)

Ardine does not currently send automated emails. This affects:

- **Team Invitations**: No invitation emails are sent. Instead, use the "Copy Invite Link" button after entering an email address, then share the link manually.
- **New Team Creation (Admin)**: In `/admin/teams`, enter an email and copy the invite link to grant someone OWNER role in the new team.
- **Password Resets**: Not yet implemented. Admins can manually reset passwords via database access if needed.
- **Notifications**: No email notifications for invoice status changes or other events.

### Workarounds

- **For team invitations**: Use Slack, your email client, or any messaging tool to share copied invite links
- **For onboarding**: Send invite links to new team members during your existing onboarding process
- **For password resets**: As a temporary measure, admins can reset passwords directly in the database

### Roadmap

Email functionality is planned for a future release and will include:

- Automated invitation emails
- Password reset flows
- Invoice delivery via email
- Configurable notification preferences

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Set strong `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- [ ] Generate secure `JWT_SECRET`
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure database backups
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy)
- [ ] Enable firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Review and adjust resource limits

### Docker Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure production environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Set production values

# 2. Build and start
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Check logs
docker-compose logs -f

# 4. Set up backups
# Add daily backup cron job for postgres_data volume
```

### Backup and Restore

#### Backup Database

```bash
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres ardine > backup.sql
```

#### Restore Database

```bash
docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres ardine < backup.sql
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check environment variables in `.env`
- Ensure database exists: `docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -l`

### Build Errors

- Clear cache: `rm -rf .next node_modules && npm install`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 20+)

### Authentication Issues

- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Check auth token expiration (7 days default)

### Port Conflicts

- Change `APP_PORT` in `.env` if port 3000 is in use
- Change `POSTGRES_PORT` in `.env` if port 5432 is in use

## Performance Tips

- Use the GraphQL API for complex queries with nested data
- Indexes are pre-configured for common query patterns
- Time entries are indexed by team, user, and date ranges
- Enable database connection pooling (default configuration)
